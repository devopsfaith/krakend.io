Unfortunately, IBM&amp;rsquo;s API Gateway service was deprecated and shut down on August 31st, 2022. Existing endpoints will no longer route to their respective functions or apps.
A blog post by IBM Cloud published on June 8th provided some tips and recommendations for IBM Cloud API Gateway users. For those users who still require an API Gateway as part of their platform architecture, KrakenD has been suggested as an alternative.</description></item><item><title>How we built our telemetry service</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/building-a-telemetry-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 09:40:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/building-a-telemetry-service/</guid><description>â€‹ We have run our telemetry system live for the past three years now. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll share code and outline some of the things you&amp;rsquo;ll need to keep in mind if you want to build an anonymous usage reporting system for an open-source project as we did at a ridiculous cost.
We have an activity of 700,000 reporting servers/month with a monthly cost betwen 5 and 10 EUR ($12).</description></item><item><title>gRPC-gateway as a KrakenD plugin</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-grpc-gateway-plugin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 18:26:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-grpc-gateway-plugin/</guid><description>The gRPC protocol is becoming trendy in the era of microservices. Its compactness and backward-compatibility make it very attractive. However, it requires custom code to work with it. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to get all the benefits from the gRPC protocol and the gRPC-gateway without coding any business logic to use your gRPC services as regular backends. Moreover, avoiding the extra network hop!</description></item><item><title>Running the KrakenD API Gateway on Kubernetes</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 18:47:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>In this article we are going to show how to configure and deploy the KrakenD API Gateway in a kubernetes environment.
We will use for the demonstration Minikube so you cant test it in your own local machine.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!
Setting up a local Kubernetes We will run Kubernetes locally thanks to Minikube. Just follow the README in the project for the installation and the Quickstart section. Installing minikube it&amp;rsquo;s quick and easy.</description></item><item><title>Website development as a sysadmin</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/website-development-as-a-sysadmin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 May 2018 16:18:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/website-development-as-a-sysadmin/</guid><description>As a systems administrator for the past 15 years, I&amp;rsquo;m not very used to web development as this kind of work has been usually done by other colleagues in every company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for. I wanted to create a web application myself using an external API, as an exercise to go out my comfort zone.
Some time ago I found that Marvel Comics has a REST API where you can get a lot of information about comics, characters, authors and other interesting information.</description></item><item><title>Edge computing - A story of buses, raspberries, IoT and API gateways</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-raspberry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 21:25:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-raspberry/</guid><description>The IoT industry has been running for some years now adding millions of devices into the network. The range of devices and capabilities is very wide and heterogeneous, from small devices powered with a 9-volt battery to track the location of freight shippings traveling the oceans (using platforms like Sigfox) to permanently plugged devices with more powerful computing like a Raspberry Pi where computation cycles are not a problem.
Generally speaking, all these devices collect raw data and send it to the cloud where big data centers process it.</description></item><item><title>Deploying and versioning an API Gateway</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/deploying-an-api-gateway/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 23:46:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/deploying-an-api-gateway/</guid><description>When it comes to maintaining and deploying an API Gateway within an organization, you should always be aware of best practice. A gateway is an extra step between the client and the servers with the power to define a whole new interface, yet it&amp;rsquo;s so flexible and easy to implement that you might be tempted to start creating API interfaces without thinking about it - and end up creating problems for the future.</description></item><item><title>An API Gateway is not the new Unicorn</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/what-is-an-api-gateway/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:10:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/what-is-an-api-gateway/</guid><description>The more we talk to people about API gateways, the more we have come to realize that the term means different things to different people, and more specifically we see a growing trend where developers (but mostly managers) expect an API gateway to be able to perform miracles, usually a long way away from its intended use.
It&amp;rsquo;s as if the API Gateway is the new unicorn that will solve all problems and make everything wonderful in the microservices scene.</description></item></channel></rss>
