Cyber threats are an everyday reality, and they don&amp;rsquo;t care how big or complex your infrastructure is. They just want a way in. This is where KrakenD, a leading API gateway company, steps in. We&amp;rsquo;ve got your back with our robust solution, built around a zero-trust policy, OWASP guidelines, and a bunch of other cool stuff to bolster your API security.</description></item><item><title>Canary releases with KrakenD: Safely roll out API changes</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/canary-releases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/canary-releases/</guid><description>Canary release is a powerful technique that helps organizations deploy changes to their APIs in a controlled and gradual manner. Instead of publishing changes to receive the impact of all traffic when going live, you expose the changes to a small subset of the traffic. The Canary Release allows for thorough monitoring and validation, reducing the risk of potential issues affecting the entire system.
This blog post will explore three ways of implementing Canary Releases on KrakenD, ensuring smoother deployments and enhanced reliability.</description></item><item><title>Traffic mirroring: test APIs without tests</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-shadow-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-shadow-testing/</guid><description>Integration and load testing are in the list of best practices in our sector, but synthesizing good inputs for such tests and analyzing the results are usually two hard things to achieve. This post will show you how we suggest our customers set up a shadow testing system with minimal impact on the production environment and proper harness.

Its compactness and backward-compatibility make it very attractive. However, it requires custom code to work with it. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to get all the benefits from the gRPC protocol and the gRPC-gateway without coding any business logic to use your gRPC services as regular backends. Moreover, avoiding the extra network hop!</description></item><item><title>How we run KrakenD on Javascript with WebAssembly</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-wasm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-wasm/</guid><description>KrakenD is an API Gateway written in Go that uses a single configuration file to define its whole behavior. As the configuration file might be complicated, the KrakenDesigner is a javascript-based user interface to edit this file, and we were missing the capability of reproducing directly on javascript the existing gateway pipes so that users could run manual tests over the editing configuration.
In this post, we are going to explain how we included KrakenD framework components in a .</description></item><item><title>Reloading the config with Reflex and Docker</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/reloading-the-krakend-configuration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:06:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/reloading-the-krakend-configuration/</guid><description>Read the new documentation This is an article from 2018. You might want to see the Hot reload documentation. A recurrent question when we go around is if KrakenD configuration can be hot-reloaded, this is changing endpoints, backends, or any other configuration of the gateway while it&amp;rsquo;s running. The short answer is: No, you can&amp;rsquo;t. You must restart the server. And although we might have something to alleviate this, let us explain first why we don&amp;rsquo;t support such a feature:</description></item><item><title>Running the KrakenD API Gateway on Kubernetes</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 18:47:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>In this article we are going to show how to configure and deploy the KrakenD API Gateway in a kubernetes environment.
We will use for the demonstration Minikube so you cant test it in your own local machine.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!
Setting up a local Kubernetes We will run Kubernetes locally thanks to Minikube. Just follow the README in the project for the installation and the Quickstart section. Installing minikube it&amp;rsquo;s quick and easy.</description></item><item><title>Edge computing - A story of buses, IoT, and API gateways</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-raspberry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 21:25:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-on-raspberry/</guid><description>The IoT industry has been running for some years now adding millions of devices into the network. The range of devices and capabilities is very wide and heterogeneous, from small devices powered with a 9-volt battery to track the location of freight shippings traveling the oceans (using platforms like Sigfox) to permanently plugged devices with more powerful computing like a Raspberry Pi where computation cycles are not a problem.
Generally speaking, all these devices collect raw data and send it to the cloud where big data centers process it.</description></item></channel></rss>
