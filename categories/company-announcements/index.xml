KrakenD is a Go application and not a Java application. Therefore, it is not affected by this vulnerability in any way. As a result, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to add more noise to the chain of emails you could have probably received.
Nevertheless, during the past month, we had questions from customers who have Java systems behind KrakenD that could be vulnerable and other users that weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if KrakenD was impacted or not.</description></item><item><title>KrakenD Now Available on Auth0 Marketplace</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-auth0-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-auth0-announcement/</guid><description>Barcelona â€“ 15th June 2020 â€“ KrakenD today announced the availability of its API Gateway on Auth0 Marketplace, a catalog of trusted technology integrations to extend the functionality of Auth0â€™s identity management platform.
