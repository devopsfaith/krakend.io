      <description>It&#39;s been only one month since we released KrakenD 0.8, and although we have been releasing new versions approximately every 3 months, we have very interesting features that can&#39;t wait! KrakenD 0.9 comes with a series of very demanded features. Let&#39;s get started!
Integration with AMQP The AMQP integration allows you to send and receive messages to and from a queue through the KrakenD API Gateway. This feature enables the gateway to become in both a subscriber and a consumer of messages for asynchronous processing and opens the doors to very different implementations we were seeing.</description>

      <description>The next iteration of KrakenD is right around the corner and the Devops Faith team and the rest of the community we are working together to launch the 0.4 release before end of year. The jump from the 0.3.9 of the binary and the 0.3 of the framework to the 0.4 will bring a lot of interesting stuff but we also need to do a remarkable change in the code for a brighter future: kill external dependencies with fire.</description>

In this post we will explain the reasons behind this decision that might sound crazy from a business perspective in the first place. Why anyone would publish the paid software increment bits of an existing free software?
A look back&amp;hellip; If you are reading this post chances are that you know this already, in short KrakenD is the fastest API Gateway in the market.</description>
