It only requires you to pass the path the configuration file (which defines behaviors and endpoints). Additionally, you can enable the debug with the -d flag, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much everything.
TL;DR Generate a configuration file with your endpoints definition. The easier way to generate it is using the designer Check the syntax of your krakend.json is good Syntax checking&amp;nbsp; $krakend check --config krakend.</description></item><item><title>Lura vs. KrakenD</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.4/overview/krakend-vs-krakend-ce/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.4/overview/krakend-vs-krakend-ce/</guid><description>If you had a quick look at our git repositories or the documentation, you might be confused at first, as there is something called the Lura Project and also KrakenD.
