KrakenD&amp;rsquo;s AI Gateway integrates multiple layers of security at the edge to enforce zero-trust AI operations. From isolated authorization flows to data masking and exfiltration prevention, you can safeguard data traveling between clients and LLM providers without altering your existing API infrastructure.
The following key features are explained in this document:
Isolated Authentication (JWT + API key separation) API Key Injection (backend-only exposure) Data Masking (request &amp;amp; response layers) Exfiltration Prevention Patterns Isolated Authentication KrakenD separates the authentication flows between consumers and LLM on your AI endpoints.</description></item><item><title>AI usage monitoring</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/ai-gateway/usage-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/ai-gateway/usage-monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring AI backends in KrakenD does not require special treatment. AI services are integrated and handled just like any other backend in your API Gateway. Your existing monitoring tools and practices, such as OpenTelemetry, remain fully applicable.
AI backends, regardless of their complexity, respond to API calls just like any other backend service. KrakenD treats AI integrations as regular backends. This simplifies observability and operational consistency by applying proven monitoring frameworks without specialized or separate tooling.</description></item></channel></rss>
