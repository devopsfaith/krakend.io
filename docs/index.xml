As KrakenD is a piece of software in the middle of two parts, there are different types of mTLS supported, that can work together or separately.
Service mTLS: When you require end-users to provide a certificate to connect to KrakenD. Client mTLS: When you require KrakenD to provide a certificate to connect to your services.</description></item><item><title>Securing B2B communication with mTLS</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.3/authorization/mutual-authentication/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.3/authorization/mutual-authentication/</guid><description>Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) is an authentication mechanism used traditionally in business-to-business (B2B) applications where clients provide a certificate that allows to connect to the KrakenD server.
The certificates must be recognized by your system&amp;rsquo;s Certification Authority (CA). KrakenD relies on the machine where is running.
Configuring mutual authentication From the configuration file perspective, Mutual TLS Authentication is no more than flag at the root level of the configuration.
When mTLS is enabled, all KrakenD endpoints require clients to provide a known client-side X.</description></item><item><title>Securing B2B communication with mTLS</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.4/authorization/mutual-authentication/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/v1.4/authorization/mutual-authentication/</guid><description>Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) is an authentication mechanism used traditionally in business-to-business (B2B) applications where clients provide a certificate that allows to connect to the KrakenD server.
