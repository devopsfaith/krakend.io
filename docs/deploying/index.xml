Instead, any configuration data and application state exist within the configuration file. Nodes are expendable and replaceable at any time, as they do not hold anything.
A KrakenD cluster consists of multiple KrakenD instances running simultaneously and working together to provide increased reliability, higher throughput, scalability, and fail-over. There is no special software that you need to run a cluster other than KrakenD.</description></item><item><title>KrakenD servers requirements</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/server-dimensioning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/server-dimensioning/</guid><description>When comparing KrakenD with other solutions, a key difference is that its Total Cost of Ownership is actually lower, and you can save a lot of money in infrastructure.
On the hardware side, KrakenD is very light and consumes very low resources. For instance, the consumption pattern of the baseline (we will see this definition below) is around 100-200MB of RAM and can work on production with 0.5 vCPU. This baseline can process thousands of requests per second.</description></item><item><title>Automated KrakenD deployments with CI/CD</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/ci-cd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/ci-cd/</guid><description>KrakenD operates with its single binary and your associated configuration. Therefore, your build process or CI/CD pipeline only needs to ensure that the configuration file is correct. These are a few recommendations to a safes KrakenD deployment:
Make sure the configuration file is valid. When using Flexible Configuration, generate the final krakend.json using FC_OUT as the final artifact Optional - Generate an immutable docker image Optional - Run integration tests Deploy the new configuration There are several ways to automate KrakenD deployments, but you must always test your configuration before applying it in production.</description></item><item><title>Generating a Docker artifact</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/docker/</guid><description>If you use containers, the recommended approach is to write your own Dockerfile and deploy an immutable artifact (embedding the config).
In its simplified form would be: FROMdevopsfaith/krakend:2.0.6COPY krakend.json /etc/krakend/krakend.json# Uncomment with Enterprise image:# COPY LICENSE /etc/krakend/LICENSE
Volume or copy? Even though you can use the official container directly and attach the configuration mounting an external volume (or ConfigMap in Kubernetes), a custom image with your configuration copied inside has benefits.</description></item><item><title>Deploying to Kubernetes</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/deploying/kubernetes/</guid><description>Deploying KrakenD in Kubernetes requires a straightforward configuration.
Create a Dockerfile that includes the configuration of the service. Read how to generate a Docker artifact for detailed instructions. You could also use a ConfigMap, although the recommendation is to use immutable artifacts.
From here you need to create a NodePort and send all the traffic to KrakenD.
Deployment definition YAML The KrakenD deployment definition, in a file called deployment-definition.yaml:
