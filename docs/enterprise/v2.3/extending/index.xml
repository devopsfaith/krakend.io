However, make sure to write them implementing the correct interface and compile them respecting the requirements. In this document, we will see how to do it right.
Introduction to plugins Before getting your hands dirty, read the introduction to plugins to understand the different plugins you can use and choose the one that best adapts to your needs.</description></item><item><title>Loading and injecting plugins</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/injecting-plugins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/injecting-plugins/</guid><description>You have developed your plugin or are in the middle of it. There are two phases to take into account:
Loading the plugin Injecting the plugin in a specific place Loading the plugin KrakenD registers plugins during startup according to its plugin configuration:
{ &amp;#34;version&amp;#34;: 3, &amp;#34;plugin&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;pattern&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;.so&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;folder&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;/opt/krakend/plugins/&amp;#34; } } Add the plugin keyword at the root of your configuration to let KrakenD know the rules to register plugins.</description></item><item><title>HTTP handler plugins</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/http-server-plugins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/http-server-plugins/</guid><description>The HTTP server plugins (codenamed as handler plugins) belong to the router layer and let you modify the requests before KrakenD starts processing them or modify the final response back to the user. The HTTP handler plugin lets you write your servers and HTTP middlewares right in KrakenD and enables you to implement anything you can imagine. This plugin type is so powerful that you can use it to implement custom monetization, tracking, tenant control, protocol conversion, and heavy modifications, for example.</description></item><item><title>HTTP Client plugins (proxy layer)</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/http-client-plugins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/http-client-plugins/</guid><description>The HTTP client plugins execute in the proxy layer, this is when KrakenD tries to reach your backends for content. They allow you to intercept, transform, and manipulate the requests before they hit your backend services, and its way back. It is the perfect time to modify the request before it reaches the backend.
HTTP client plugins cannot be chained. You can use up to one plugin per backend connection.</description></item><item><title>Request and response modifier plugins</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/plugin-modifiers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/plugin-modifiers/</guid><description>The request and response modifier plugins are a type of KrakenD customization that allow you to code your own business logic directly on requests and responses in a simple and extensible way. These plugins complement the handler plugins, and the client executor plugins and avoid their limitations and extra overload.
The injecting of the modifiers is placed at the beginning of the proxy pipe (just after the router layer) and before the request executor (where the executor plugins are injected).</description></item><item><title>Validate your plugin compatibility</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/check-plugin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.3/extending/check-plugin/</guid><description>The krakend check-plugin command helps you validate the compatibility of your custom plugins that will run in conjunction with KrakenD.
The command compares your plugin&amp;rsquo;s go.sum file with the libraries initially used to compile the running binary. If there are any incompatibilities between your plugin and KrakenD, it will show a detailed list.
If you integrate this command as part of your CI/CD pipeline, it will exit with a status code 0 when the libraries of your plugin are compatible with KrakenD and with a status code 1 when they are not.</description></item></channel></rss>
