KrakenD&amp;rsquo;s AI Gateway integrates multiple layers of security at the edge to enforce zero-trust AI operations. From isolated authorization flows to data masking and exfiltration prevention, you can safeguard data traveling between clients and LLM providers without altering your existing API infrastructure.
The following key features are explained in this document:
Isolated Authentication (JWT + API key separation) API Key Injection (backend-only exposure) Data Masking (request &amp;amp; response layers) Exfiltration Prevention Patterns Isolated Authentication KrakenD separates the authentication flows between consumers and LLM on your AI endpoints.</description></item><item><title>AI Token Cost Control &amp; Quotas</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/budget-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/budget-control/</guid><description>AI workloads can quickly generate unpredictable and excessive costs. KrakenD&amp;rsquo;s AI Gateway provides granular token usage monitoring and enforcement to keep your AI expenses transparent and within budget. Features like token quotas, budget alerts, prompt caching, and intelligent routing enable you to optimize requests and avoid surprise bills while maintaining performance and scalability.
Token Quota and Budget Enforcement KrakenD Enterprise includes a powerful persistent quota system that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for managing token-based usage quotas in LLM applications, designer for controlling cost, enforcing subscription tiers, and preventing overuse.</description></item><item><title>AI Governance</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/governance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/governance/</guid><description>KrakenD AI Governance empowers organizations to deploy large language models responsibly by enforcing compliance, security, and operational guardrails inline with AI traffic. Leverage granular controls on prompts, responses, usage, and reuse of prompt templates to standardize AI across teams, tenants, and projects.
Prompt Policy Enforcement Prompt policies enforce constraints on input prompts by pattern matching, contextual validation, or checking request metadata to prevent abusive or sensitive content from being processed downstream.</description></item><item><title>AI usage monitoring</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/usage-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/ai-gateway/usage-monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring AI backends in KrakenD does not require special treatment. AI services are integrated and handled just like any other backend in your API Gateway. Your existing monitoring tools and practices, such as OpenTelemetry, remain fully applicable.
AI backends, regardless of their complexity, respond to API calls just like any other backend service. KrakenD treats AI integrations as regular backends. This simplifies observability and operational consistency by applying proven monitoring frameworks without specialized or separate tooling.</description></item></channel></rss>
