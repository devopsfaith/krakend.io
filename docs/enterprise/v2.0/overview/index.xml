When you get a license from sales, its placement and format must comply with what the binary expects.
When the license file is incorrect, KrakenD warns you about it but the server will start anyway.
The message you will see when the server starts with an invalid or missing license file is:
Term&amp;nbsp; $krakend run -dec krakend.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise plugins</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/plugins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/plugins/</guid><description>A great deal of the functionality offered by KrakenD Enterprise is presented as plugins, and other as components. It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand a few concepts and particularities of plugins before you start using them.
What is a plugin? A plugin is a soft-linked library; thus, a separated binary file (.so), that when running in conjunction with KrakenD, can participate in the processing. Plugins and middlewares are close concepts, but while middlewares are part of the KrakenD binary, plugins are not.</description></item><item><title>Lura vs. KrakenD</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/lura-vs-krakend/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/lura-vs-krakend/</guid><description>If you had a quick look at our git repositories or the documentation, you might be confused at first, as there is something called the Lura Project and also KrakenD.
TL;DR; Difference between Lura, KrakenD, and Enterprise Lura is the KrakenD&amp;rsquo;s engine. Formerly known as &amp;ldquo;KrakenD framework&amp;rdquo; until we donated it to The Linux Foundation on 2021. It is not a product itself but a toolkit/set of libraries to build API gateways.</description></item><item><title>The KrakenD Enterprise Playground</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/playground/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/playground/</guid><description>The KrakenD Enterprise Playground is a Docker Compose demonstration environment that puts together the necessary pieces to get you started with our API Gateway, using example use-cases.
As KrakenD is an API gateway, we have added surrounding services:
Internal and third-party services that feed the gateway Authentication/authorization examples, including JWT token-based authentication with Auth0 integration, a JWT token revoker, API-Key-based authentication, and basic authentication. Static assets to test the by KrakenD Static Server based on disk content Integrations with Grafana+Influx (metrics), ELK (log storing and visualization), and Jaeger (tracing).</description></item><item><title>Tutorials and Guides</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/guides/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v2.0/overview/guides/</guid><description>The documentation in this site covers all the functionality of KrakenD API Gateway, but over time we have received from KrakenD users all kinds of tutorials, guides and other resources that illustrate how to do a specific thing.
