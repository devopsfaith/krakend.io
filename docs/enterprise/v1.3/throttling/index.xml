Bots are detected by inspecting the User-Agent and comparing its value with a set of configuration rules provided by you. The bot detector module does not set any initial rules, meaning that is up to you to decide the best rules for your use case, and choose how restrictive or permissive you are with bots.</description></item><item><title>Timeouts</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v1.3/throttling/timeouts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v1.3/throttling/timeouts/</guid><description>Being KrakenD an API Gateway that talks to other services, being able to control the waiting times for different aspects is crucial. KrakenD will allow you to fine-tune these settings.
The timeouts can apply to:
The duration of the whole pipe (from user request to user response) The HTTP request related timeouts Additionally, you can control the number of maximum IDLE connections.
Pipe timeouts Global timeout The timeout key in the krakend.</description></item><item><title>Maximum IDLE connections</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v1.3/throttling/max-idle-connections/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/v1.3/throttling/max-idle-connections/</guid><description>Having a high number of IDLE connections to every backend affects directly to the performance of the proxy layer. This is why you can control the number using the max_idle_connections setting. For instance:
{ &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: 2, &amp;quot;max_idle_connections&amp;quot;: 150, ... } KrakenD will close connections sitting idle in a &amp;ldquo;keep-alive&amp;rdquo; state when max_idle_connections is reached. If no value is set in the configuration file, KrakenD will use 250 by default.
Every ecosystem needs its own setting, have this in mind:</description></item></channel></rss>
