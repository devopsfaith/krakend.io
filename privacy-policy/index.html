Who is responsible for processing your personal data?</h4><ul><li>Identity: KRAKEND, S.L (hereinafter KrakenD or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)</li><li>Address: Plaça Universitat 3, 6º, 08007 Barcelona, España</li><li>E-mail: <a href=mailto:hello@krakend.io>hello@krakend.io</a></li><li>Contact details of the Data Protection Officer: <a href=mailto:hello@krakend.io>hello@krakend.io</a></li></ul><h4 id=2-for-what-purpose-do-we-process-your-personal-data>2. For what purpose do we process your personal data?</h4><p>At KrakenD we process the information provided by interested parties for the following purposes:</p><p>I. To manage the registration of users and to control the development and fulfilment of the contractual relationship with them and, in this respect, to provide the service of on-line sale of the products offered through the website <a href=https://www.krakend.io>https://www.krakend.io</a>. In particular, KrakenD will process the following categories of data and for the purposes specified below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Categories of personal data</th><th>Purposes of treatment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic contact information (e-mail address).</td><td>Customer contact for performing the contractual relationship; advertising (if applicable).</td></tr><tr><td>Usage data, in particular technical and device-related information and data transmission (IP address, functional and web monitoring data, login and web usage data).</td><td>Customisation of offers; error resolution, fraud prevention, service improvement, improved user interface and, if applicable, marketing.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>II. to manage complaints, as well as to respond to queries that may be submitted by users in relation to the website or services;</p><p>III. to send commercial communications, including by electronic means, about our products and services that we think may interest you;</p><p>IV. to manage your participation in competitions and promotional activities carried out by KrakenD;</p><p>V. to process information that we have obtained through cookies, as described in more detail in the Cookie Policy. Such processing is fully subject to what is established in the aforementioned policy;</p><p>VI. To comply with the legal obligations applicable to KrakenD, such as those derived from tax regulations and the prevention of money laundering.</p><h4 id=3-what-is-the-legitimacy-of-the-processing-of-your-data>3. What is the legitimacy of the processing of your data?</h4><p>The legal basis for the processing indicated in sections (I) and (II) is the execution of the Conditions of Use and of the Contract.</p><p>With regard to sections (III), (IV) and (V), the legal basis is the consent given by the user, which he may revoke at any time without affecting the provision of the service. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the following e-mail address: <a href=mailto:hello@krakend.io>hello@krakend.io</a>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the electronic and non-electronic commercial communications sent when we have your consent as cited above, we may also send you communications when you are our customer. In this case, we will only send you information that is linked to us and that is related to products and/or services of ours that are identical or similar to those you have contracted. In these cases, we have a legitimate interest in processing your contact details and keeping you informed about any of our products and services, and this interest takes precedence over your rights in view of the non-sensitive nature of the data in question and the fact that the contractual relationship created with our customers results in the reasonable expectation of receiving this type of communication.</p><p>Finally, the legal basis for the treatment indicated in section (VI) is compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company (as is the case with Law 58/2003, of 17 December, on General Taxation; and Law 35/2006, of 28 November, on Personal Income Tax and partially amending the laws on Corporation Tax, Non-Resident Income Tax and Wealth Tax, and their respective implementing regulations, and other regulations that may be applicable).</p><h4 id=4-how-long-will-we-keep-your-data>4. How long will we keep your data?</h4><p>The personal data provided will be kept for as long as you are a customer or registered user of our website. The personal data will be kept after the termination of the contractual relationship, duly blocked, for the periods established by law to meet the responsibilities that may arise from it. In particular, the personal data necessary to send you electronic commercial communications will be processed until you revoke the consent you have given and, once this has been withdrawn, for the time strictly necessary to respond to any liabilities that may have arisen. In any case, when the personal data is not necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and until it is definitively deleted, it will be kept blocked.</p><h4 id=5-to-which-recipients-will-your-data-be-communicated>5. To which recipients will your data be communicated?</h4><p>No data will be communicated to third parties unless legally obliged to do so or when strictly necessary to defend the rights and legitimate interests of KrakenD. Without prejudice to the above, personal data will be accessible to those third parties to whom KrakenD has entrusted a service in their capacity as data processors (e.g. technical and IT support providers), both with regard to the operation of the business and the administration of the Company. The Company shall enter into written agreements with the third parties participating in the provision of the services, which shall include the safeguards and guarantees required by the GDPR.</p><p>KrakenD uses some cookies and technologies from third parties whose servers are, in certain cases, located outside the European Economic Area, your data may be transferred to those servers located in third countries (in particular, the United States). In any case, please note that KrakenD enters into agreements with such suppliers to ensure a level of data protection equivalent to that provided by European regulations. In particular, where necessary, standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission will be signed and, for international transfers to the United States, it will be ensured that contracted providers are registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement.</p><h4 id=6-what-are-your-rights-when-you-provide-us-with-your-data>6. What are your rights when you provide us with your data?</h4><p>Everyone has the right to obtain information about whether or not KrakenD is processing personal data concerning them.</p><p>Data subjects have the right to access their personal data, as well as the right to request the rectification of inaccurate data (and to complete those that are insufficient), to request its deletion when, among other reasons, the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and to request its portability.</p><p>In certain circumstances, data subjects may request that their data be limited in their processing, in which case we will only keep them for the exercise or defence of claims.</p><p>In certain circumstances and for reasons related to their particular situation, data subjects may object to the processing of their data. In this case, KrakenD will stop processing the data, except for compelling legitimate reasons, or the exercise or defence of possible claims.</p><p>You may exercise your rights by sending an e-mail to <a href=mailto:hello@krakend.io>hello@krakend.io</a>, duly identifying yourself and indicating the specific right you wish to exercise.</p><p>If you have given your consent for any specific purpose, you are entitled to withdraw the consent given at any time, without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given prior to its withdrawal.</p><p>In the event that you feel your rights have been infringed with regard to the protection of your personal data, especially when you have not obtained satisfaction in the exercise of your rights vis-à-vis the Company, you may file a complaint with the competent Data Protection supervisory authority</p><h4 id=7-more-information-about-the-processing-of-your-data>7. More information about the processing of your data</h4><p>The processing of the data collected through the data collection forms on the website or other means will be incorporated into the Processing Activities Register for which KrakenD is responsible.</p><p>KrakenD treats the data confidentially and adopts the appropriate technical and organisational measures to guarantee the appropriate level of security for the processing, in compliance with the requirements of the GDPR, Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights and other applicable regulations on data protection.</p><p>Nevertheless, it cannot guarantee the absolute invulnerability of the systems, therefore, and to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable legislation, it does not assume any responsibility for damages derived from alterations that third parties may cause in the computer systems, electronic documents or files of the user. If you choose to leave our web site through links to web sites that do not belong to our entity, KrakenD shall not be responsible for the privacy policies of those web sites or for the cookies that they may store in the user&rsquo;s computer.</p></section></div><div class="print:hidden bg-gradient-to-r from-denim-500 to-denim-800 py-8"><div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:flex sm:space-y-0 space-y-4 text-center sm:text-left items-center justify-between px-8"><div class="flex-none text-xl font-medium text-white"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-5 w-5 inline" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M2.003 5.884 10 9.882l7.997-3.998A2 2 0 0016 4H4A2 2 0 002.003 5.884z"/><path d="M18 8.118l-8 4-8-4V14a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8.118z"/></svg>Stay up to date with KrakenD releases and important updates</div><div class=flex-grow><form action="https://krakend.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=5cae4bbe9877b1adfe8fe808d&amp;id=e5385eb57b&amp;v_id=4265&amp;f_id=006687e4f0" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class=validate target=_blank novalidate><div style=position:absolute;left:-5000px aria-hidden=true><input type=text name=b_5cae4bbe9877b1adfe8fe808d_e5385eb57b tabindex=-1></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center sm:justify-end"><input type=email name=EMAIL class="block rounded-l px-3 py-1 w-full max-w-xs" id=mce-EMAIL placeholder="email address" required>
