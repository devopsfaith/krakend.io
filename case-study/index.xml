Before KrakenD, the main challenge of Veepee was to integrate Salesforce with multiple microservices and handle authorization, security, and aggregation in the middle layers.
KrakenD solved this challenge with out of the box features, keeping Privalia&#39;s logic separated, and decoupled from Salesforce.</description>
