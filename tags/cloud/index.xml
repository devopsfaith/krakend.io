Unfortunately, IBM&amp;rsquo;s API Gateway service was deprecated and shut down on August 31st, 2022. Existing endpoints will no longer route to their respective functions or apps.
A blog post by IBM Cloud published on June 8th provided some tips and recommendations for IBM Cloud API Gateway users. For those users who still require an API Gateway as part of their platform architecture, KrakenD has been suggested as an alternative.</description></item></channel></rss>
