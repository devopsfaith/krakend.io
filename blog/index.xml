The Lura Project&amp;rsquo;s mission is to offer an extendable, simple, and stateless high-performance API Gateway framework designed for cloud-native and on-prem setups. Rather than solving a specific use case, Lura provides a library of components, a framework for assembling them into custom API gateway systems like a Lego set.</description></item><item><title>Albert Garcia to expand KrakenD business.</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/albert-garcia-expand-krakend-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/albert-garcia-expand-krakend-business/</guid><description>Today, we are announcing that Albert Garcia recently joined KrakenD as Director of Business Development and member of the Board.

KrakenDesigner is an aid tool to generate KrakenD configurations for the uninitiated audience. It produces a verbose output of the configuration file and explicitly writes unneeded attributes to let you see that a specific configuration option exists. These attributes I am mentioning are not necessary because they contain default values and the server is not going to alter its behavior.</description></item><item><title>KrakenD 0.9 released</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.9-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.9-release-notes/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been only one month since we released KrakenD 0.8, and although we have been releasing new versions approximately every 3 months, we have very interesting features that can&amp;rsquo;t wait! KrakenD 0.9 comes with a series of very demanded features. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!
Integration with AMQP The AMQP integration allows you to send and receive messages to and from a queue through the KrakenD API Gateway. This feature enables the gateway to become in both a subscriber and a consumer of messages for asynchronous processing and opens the doors to very different implementations we were seeing.</description></item><item><title>KrakenD 0.8 released</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.8-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.8-release-notes/</guid><description>KrakenD 0.8 is a significant release as it brings numerous code changes and functionality. The framework brings +100 commits, the gateway +50 commits and even more changes in the components. A lot of refactoring and component updates has taken place. The big picture is a move from a single binary application to become a package with several internal binaries.
See the details below.

As the configuration file might be complicated, the KrakenDesigner is a javascript-based user interface to edit this file, and we were missing the capability of reproducing directly on javascript the existing gateway pipes so that users could run manual tests over the editing configuration.

During this release, we also updated the KrakenD brand with a new logo, and we added more documentation.
On the metrics side, we can now send structured events using GELF to your Graylog Cluster.

TL;DR This release brings HTTP2 and HTTPS to KrakenD. It also upgrades Go from 1.10 to 1.11 and fixes forwarded query string parameters to backends that are using arrays and repeated variables.
The KrakenDesigner (UI) is also updated to reflect these changes.

Autumn is around the corner (northern hemisphere), so our release is ready for a cool autumn.
TL;DR This release adds two interesting components: the JOSE component responsible for the JWT signing and validation, and the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) component. There is also a Consul client available.

The short answer is: No, you can&amp;rsquo;t. You must restart the server. And although we might have something to alleviate this, let us explain first why we don&amp;rsquo;t support such a feature:

This release focuses heavily on metrics and its export options to different backend systems such as Zipkin, InfluxDB, Prometheus or Jaeger. It also adds the NoOp logger and exposes all the advanced settings of the http client and server, giving all the power to the user.

The range of devices and capabilities is very wide and heterogeneous, from small devices powered with a 9-volt battery to track the location of freight shippings traveling the oceans (using platforms like Sigfox) to permanently plugged devices with more powerful computing like a Raspberry Pi where computation cycles are not a problem.
Generally speaking, all these devices collect raw data and send it to the cloud where big data centers process it.</description></item><item><title>How to work with Golang plugins and KrakenD</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-golang-plugins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 22:07:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-golang-plugins/</guid><description>The release of golang 1.8 more than a year ago opened the door to loading dynamic linked components in run time, and we were keen to find out if we could include this great feature in our KrakenD toolbox.

A gateway is an extra step between the client and the servers with the power to define a whole new interface, yet it&amp;rsquo;s so flexible and easy to implement that you might be tempted to start creating API interfaces without thinking about it - and end up creating problems for the future.</description></item><item><title>KrakenD 0.4 release notes</title><link>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.4-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 14:50:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.krakend.io/blog/krakend-0.4-release-notes/</guid><description>KrakenD 0.4 materializes the announcement we did 3 months ago by going full open source and public releasing the former enterprise-only components.
